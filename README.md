# LIA-IC - Q-LEARNING
IC Scientific Research Project Q-Learning applied to robotics files and implementation for simulation using Coppelia Robotics V-REP simulator.

My job here is to create a full Reinforcement Learning environment from scratch, including the world it will be executed and all codes to manipulate, act and control the RL agent in this world, doing grasping tasks.

For this we have chosen as agent a UR3 robot model, designed by Universal Robots.

Email-me for more info.

Module implementation:

[x] Controller: for vrep robot control of movement

[x] Vision: for vrep image extraction and visual recognition algorithms

[x] State: State description for Q-Learning

[] Agent: Agent description for Q-Learning

[] Learning: For learning control, that will use all modules

[] Environment: for environment variables control
